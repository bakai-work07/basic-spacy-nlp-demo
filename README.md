## 🚀 Basic spaCy NLP Demo
This was one of my first attempts at using spaCy to explore natural language processing (NLP). I ran this script on a Wikipedia article (wiki_us.txt) just to try out how spaCy handles common NLP tasks — and it helped me get a better sense of what’s going on.

# 🔍 What This Code Covers
- Sentence segmentation
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Lemmatization + syntactic dependencies
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Word vector similarity (using en_core_web_md)
- Basic token cleaning / noise reduction

# 📁 File Used
wiki_us.txt: Just a sample article on the United States pulled from Wikipedia. Any English longform text works.

# 🧠 Why I Did This
I’m currently learning how to use NLP tools for real-world applications — especially document analysis and automation. This script helped me to practice the basics, and I plan to build on it for future projects (like text classification and information extraction).
